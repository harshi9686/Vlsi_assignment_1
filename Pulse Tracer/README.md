Pulse Tracer is a digital logic module designed to detect and trace clean high pulses from a noisy input signal. It filters out glitches and noise, ensuring that only stable, valid pulses are registered and acted upon. This module is especially useful in FPGA/ASIC designs where reliable pulse detection is critical, such as in event counters, trigger systems, or digital communication interfaces.

Features:
Detects single-cycle clean high pulses

Ignores glitches or spurious transitions

Synchronous design for clocked environments

Easily integrable in larger RTL systems

Use Case:
In noisy environments or when signals come from mechanical switches or asynchronous sources, itâ€™s common to encounter short unwanted spikes. Pulse Tracer ensures that only genuine, stable high pulses are detected.

How It Works:
Input Filtering: Uses a small synchronizer or debounce logic to filter short glitches.

Edge Detection: Detects rising edges of the filtered input.

Pulse Generation: Outputs a single-cycle high pulse when a valid rising edge is detected.
